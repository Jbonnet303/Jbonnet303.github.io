Connect Five, a slightly larger version of the classic  game, “Connect Four”. 

The following technologies and tools were used in creating this game:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, google images, google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Orbitron), and color picker tool (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool).

This very similar, virtual version of the classic game “Connect Four”, is played in almost the exact same way.  Two players take turns trying to connect five game pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. 

The reason for this is because the board felt too small to fit inside the universe background. Making a larger game with a larger number of chips to place in a row seemed more fitting for the idea that it is being played in a vastly large area such as space. Chips can be visualized as planets in this war of the planets, each player takes turns, dropping planets in 8 rows 9columns, the goal of the game is to get 5 of your planets to align either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to get five of their planets in a row wins and is told so by an alert on the screen. At this point, the war has ended but can start again by clicking the reset button on the bottom of the page.

Unsolved problems, two things, make game pieces planets instead of chips, add movements and animations to the board.
