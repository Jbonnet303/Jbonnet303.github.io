Connect Five, a slightly larger version of the classic  game, “Connect Four”. 

The following technologies and tools were used in creating this game:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, stackoverflow, google images, google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/?selection.family=Orbitron), and color picker tool (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool).

This very similar, virtual version of the classic game “Connect Four”, is played in almost the exact same way.  Two players take turns trying to connect five game pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. In Connect Five, there are 8 rows and 9 columns. The reason for this is because, Connect Five takes place in outer space, which is capable of holding the larger game board. Players are identified by colored game pieces, "green" or "black". Once a game piece is dropped, it is changed from a color to a planet. Player green becomes Earth and Player black becomes Jupiter. The game has now become a battle of the planets. The first player to connect five of their planets in a line, wins, and is told so by an alert on the screen. At this point, the battle has ended. However, players are able to begin another battle and essentially start a planet war by clicking the "RESET GAME" button on the bottom of the page.

Improvements: I wish I could have added sound to the website. I did try to add music that would play continuously while visiting the website, however, I was not able to complete this. Also, I would have liked to create movement in some way on the website. One thought I had was for the planet game pieces to rotate as if spinning on an axis. However, I did not work towards attempting this. Another improvement that I could have worked on was the moble version of the game. If I visit the website on my phone, the background image is tiled or doubled.
